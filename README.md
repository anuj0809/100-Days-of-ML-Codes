# 100-Days-Of-Code

This is my repository for "100 Days of Code" Challenge where I will be primarily working with Machine Learning Codes

As part of this Challenge, I will code for atleast 1 Hour per day and log my progress in seperate folders to account for myself. I will also be encouraging others to take up Coding daily and pick up the challenge after they have familiarized themselves with the concept.
